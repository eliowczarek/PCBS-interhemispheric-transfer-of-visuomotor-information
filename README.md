Interhemispheric Transfer of Visuomotor Information
===================================================

The aim of this project is to measur thanks to a unimanual reaction time (RT) paradigm and lateralized visual stimuli an estimatation of interhemispheric transfer time in normal right-handed subjects. Poffenberger in 1912 was the first to study thanks to a real simple task to measure this time transfer between the two emispheres.
Moreover, Marzi et al. in 1991 shown other results. Firstly there is a difference in the measur of reaction time (RT) when a task is performed by only one hemisphere compared to the both (one visual stimuli treated by one hemisphere and the movement is performed thanks to the other). Secondly, they shown a difference of accuracy between the two hemisphere (one performed the tasks faster).

The experiment consist of the presentation of a dot in one hemi-field per trial (right or left), the participant has to press with one hand the key indicating the side of the dot on the screen.
Before each block there is some instructions, indicating which hand the participants has to use and which eyes he has to close. They had to close one eye in order to respect some of the paper presented in Marzi et al. (1991).
